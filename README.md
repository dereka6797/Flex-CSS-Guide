# Flex-CSS-Guide
This guide is a very simple way for me to showcase how the flex properties can be used in CSS. 
It is best used side by side, meaning you'll want to pull the code and open it in the web browser at the same time you review the code itself to gain a better understanding of how it works/looks. Enjoy!
